Real-Time Scenario: Cost Optimization in a DevOps EnvironmentðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

Company: A growing SaaS startup running its infrastructure on AWS.

Challenge: Cloud bills increased by 40% over six months due to inefficient resource allocation and unnecessary usage.


Issue 1: Over-Provisioned EC2 Instances
 â€¢ The company used large EC2 instances for staging and development, running 24/7.
 â€¢ Many instances were idle during non-business hours.

Solution:
 â€¢ Implemented auto-scaling for production workloads.
 â€¢ Scheduled automatic shutdown of non-production instances during off-hours using AWS Lambda.
 â€¢ Switched to spot instances for non-critical batch processing.

Result: 30% reduction in EC2 costs.


Issue 2: High Log Storage Costs
 â€¢ Application logs were stored in Amazon S3 with no retention policy, leading to terabytes of data.

Solution:
 â€¢ Moved old logs to S3 Glacier for cheaper long-term storage.
 â€¢ Applied lifecycle policies to auto-delete logs older than 90 days.

Result: 50% reduction in log storage costs.


Issue 3: Inefficient CI/CD Pipeline
 â€¢ Every Git commit triggered a full build and test suite, consuming unnecessary compute resources.

Solution:
 â€¢ Modified the pipeline to trigger builds only on changes to specific directories.
 â€¢ Introduced caching for dependencies, reducing build times.
 â€¢ Used self-hosted GitHub runners instead of expensive managed runners.

Result: 40% reduction in CI/CD execution costs.


Issue 4: Multiple Load Balancers for Microservices
 â€¢ Each microservice used a separate Load Balancer, significantly increasing monthly billing.

Solution:
 â€¢ Consolidated services behind a single Load Balancer per environment using path-based or host-based routing (for example, using Ingress in GKE or ALB in ECS).

Result: Noticeable cost savings and simplified networking setup.


Issue 5: Unused Container Images in Artifact Registry
 â€¢ No policy was in place to manage old container images in the registry, leading to storage bloat.

Solution:
 â€¢ Created a lifecycle policy in Artifact Registry (or ECR) to automatically delete older, unused images beyond a certain retention threshold.

Result: Reduced storage costs and improved repository hygiene.


Outcome:
After implementing these optimizations, the company reduced its AWS bill by 35% while maintaining performance and reliability.
