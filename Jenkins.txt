CICD(Continue Integration & Continue Delivery or Deployment)

Install Jenkins on Ubuntu:
     sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/Jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install openjdk-17-jdk-headless
sudo apt-get install Jenkins

Install Jenkins on Linux:
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum upgrade
# Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
sudo yum install -y java-17-amazon-corretto
sudo yum install Jenkins
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

history:
Jenkins is an open source automation server it helps automate the part of software development related to building ,testing ,deploying facility.
Continuous integration continuous delivery it is server based system that run in serverlet containers such as Apache tomcat. it support version controlling tool like 
git mercral, purpose etc.
It excutes maven & gradal based project as well as shell script windows bash command.
Jenkins has originally name as hadasen & it was rename in 2011 first release of Jenkins at 2nd Feb 2011.lincnse come under MIT, platform java

create a simple job:
dashboard > new Item > enter item name > project type(freestyle) > build step > add build step > execute shell > shell command > apply & save.
building a job 
we can build a Jenkins job with 6 diff way:
1) Manual
In this type of job we need to use Jenkins UI & we need choose particular job which we want to run you can see build now option apply button to run your particular job.
2)trigger build remotely=
for this type of build we need to set build trigger configuration when we are creating a job here we need to pass authentication token which can be anything any number
to trigger build we need to heat below url 
  JENKINS_URL/JOB/JOBNAME/build?token=TOKEN_NAME

3) build after other project are build
It will git trigger once a parent job build process is finish means job to will get run after job one get finish.
consider you have 2 jobs named as job1 and job2 where job1 is getting trigger remotely Once a job1 build process finish job2 will get trigger
here to achieve about scenario we need to configure job tools build trigger configuration as build after other project are build and mention
job1 on which we need to keep watch.



Build periodically:


we can add multiple schedule for a job:
for below two option that is 
		core scm
		GitHub hook trigger for git scm polling

Integration of GitHub account with Jenkins server:
step1: Generate Api token on Jenkins(click on profile then configure api token then add new token =>generate token)
step2: Adding webhook to your project(Project => setting => webhooks => payloadurl(jenkins url +/github-webhooks/) => content type(application/json) =>update)
if your get green tick marks if you webhooks successfully applied.



using webhooks In a jenkins job:
To use webhooks we need to create a job as a per below configuration
Add New Item => Freestyle project =>source code management (git) => repository URL => add your project URL => branch(main) =>apply & save

Note:
Once you run your job you will fine your project source code inside /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/jobname

GitHub hook trigger for git scm pooling:
when Jenkins receive a GitHub push a hook ,GitHub plugging check to see whether the hook clam for GitHub repository which match be git repository 
scm/gitsession of your job. it is match your job will get trigger.

PollScm:
This is Similar to build periodically but it will check to option 
1)schedule:
2)GitHub push hoop:

CI-CD project on1:
Deploying & web application with the help of ansible & Jenkins:
	1) create 4 EC2 instance inside 4 vpc(developer machine, Jenkins machine, Ansible server, webserver)
	2) Jenkins machine install Jenkins
				yum install java* -y
				yum install Jenkins -y
				sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    				https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
				sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io-2023.key
				sudo yum upgrade
				# Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
				yum install java
				sudo yum install fontconfig java-17-openjdk
				sudo yum install jenkins
	3)Configure Ansible server:	
				Install Ansible
				yum install ansible -y
			        ## create a group called web server inside /etc/ansible/hosts
				[web]
				private Ip(web)
			
	4)Configure web server:
				yum install nginx -y
				systemctl start nginx
				systemctl status nginx
			## create a password less connection between ansible & web server.
			## create a password less connection between Jenkins & Ansible
