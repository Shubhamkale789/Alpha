Initially after joining I was part of manufacturing team, After some months there was need of a person who can work for CSV workload, due to my computer skills and hands on knowledge about windows OS my supervisor told me to work for CSV also. Then I started to work on CSV along with manufacturing. As being the part of CSV team I was in touch with IT team and I was having all the access to IT infrastructure of company. One day I asked one of my seniors about the working of whole Infrastructure of our company and they told me about the AWS and Virtualization. After coming to home I searched more about AWS and then actually I developed the curiosity to learn about the AWS cloud. I started to learn about the cloud technologies and after learning the AWS my seniors was giving me some basic responsibilities to do on AWS. I was responsible for managing the security groups, IAM roles and policies, VPCs, Subnets. etc. After learning about the AWS I got to know about DevOps as an emerging technology in the field of Software development and then I started to learn about the DevOps tools to automate the infrastructure and deployment. As soon as I learned about Docker and Kubernetes I was given the basic tasks like writing dockerfile and Kubernetes manifest file for creating and managing the containers, I was also responsible for writing terraform files for creating the infrastructure on cloud.
